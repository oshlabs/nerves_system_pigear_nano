# NOTE that the settings for Pigear Nano are incompatible with the
# earlier used PI4B. This is because Pigear Nano uses pin18 for
# connecting a SPI bus controlling the MCP2515 CAN interface,
# where on PI4B in V1Rig that same pin was used to do hardware
# PWM to control the LED panel.
#
# In order to still get a single firmware for both hardware versions,
# this config.txt should be able to to differentiate by board model.

#
# Especially on 2nd link, see at bottom of page where PI4B uses board code a03111 to d03115
# I did not test this yet, but when making single firmware for v1rig,
# update below section:

## [all] # <- instead of all, put proper board type here
## dtoverlay=pwm,pin=18,func=2
